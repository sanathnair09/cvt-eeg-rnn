# Datasets

- the first one i found was a Kaggle competition from 7 yrs ago (https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection/data). This dataset is composed of iEEG scans from dogs.
    - https://github.com/MichaelHills/seizure-detection this was the code of the winner for that competition

- There was also a similar competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/data), which I believed used a similar, if not the same, dataset.
